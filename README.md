# CISSP Study Material 
This repository contains my lecture notes for cybrary's [Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)]().
## The 8 domains of CISSP 
- Domain 1 : `Security and Risk Management`  16%
- Domain 2 : `Asset Security`  10%
- Domain 3 : `Security Architecture and Engineering` 12%
	+ Security Architecture and Design 
	+ Software Development Security (Domain 8)
	+ Cryptography
- Domain 4 : `Communication and Network Security`   12%
- Domain 5 : `Identity and Access Management`  13%
- Domain 6 : `Security Assessment and Testing`  11%
- Domain 7 : `Security Operations`  16%
	+ Redundancy 
	+ Continuity of the Enterprise
- Domain 8 : `Software Development Security`  10%

> NB : Domain 1 and 7 have the biggest weight, we can think of it as every decision starts with risk management (Domain 1) and it marches towards business continuity (the biggest chunk of domain 7) and everything in between enables that to happen.  
> Risk Management is the start --> Business Continuity is the ultimate goal.
