We start by looking at policies : 
- `Corporate policy` (Organizational policy): state management commitment to security. 
> Policies dont frequently change, Standards are the ones we change instead, Policies are very broad and generic 
- `System Specific Policy` : directed at an individual system. Example : "before accessing {domain controllers}, users must provide a multifactor authentication based on the type of access they're to be granted"
- `Issue Specific Policy` : Nebulous issues within the organisation we need to define because we cant rely on common sense. Example : 
	+ **Change Management Policy** : we dont just make changes out of the blue.
	+ **Acceptable Use Policy** : how can you use company ressources
	+ **Privacy** : users and employees expect privacy in the workplace, if employers are to infringe up on privacy of employees they must inform them -> most important thing is notification 
	+ **Data/System Ownership** : make sure its clear, because the system and the data owners are the ones to determine the classifications and dictate the controls.
	+ **Seperation of Duties SOD** : no one individual must have too much power and authority to do too many things, the person that prints the pay-checks isnt the one who signs them. It forces collusion : many people should collude to commit a fraud. 
	+ **Mandatory Vacations**
